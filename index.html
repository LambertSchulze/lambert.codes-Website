      <p>This site is about a man who creates things by writing code.<br>
        The name of this man is Lambert.</p>
      <p>Creating things with code brings joy to this man because these things he creates can be 
        <ul>
          <li>helpful</li>
          <li>insightful</li>
        </ul>
        or just
        <ul>
          <li>nice to look at</li>
        </ul>
        (at least for him).</p>
      <p>Making helpful tools for problems he found in his life, is what brought this man to sit down and learn to code.</p>
      <p>Getting insight from gathering and displaying data gave him a new look at himself and his surroundings.</p>
      <p>Trying to make things look Ã¦sthetic gave food for his soul.</p>
      <p>On this site this coding man would like to share what gives him meaning.</p>
